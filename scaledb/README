Known problems with the test suite template
-------------------------------------------


ScaleDB produces warnings upon shutdown. I am getting two of them:

160115 16:05:47 [Warning] Plugin 'ScaleDB' will be forced to shutdown
2016-01-15 16:05:07 ScaleDB Message: [Warning] [Tcpip Client - attempting to connect to server... ]

The second one *might* be caused by forced termination of ScaleDB processes (cas and/or slm). 
If so, we'll need to think what to do about it in the test suite -- might be not easy, --
or just add a global suppression. 

I don't know what causes the first one, about being forced to shutdown.

-----------------------------

If the server has to be restarted during test suite execution, e.g. if it's run with

mysql-test-run.pl scaledb.hello_scaledb scaledb.hello_scaledb  --force-restart --force

the second time the server does not come up, at least for me, just stops at ScaleDB startup. 
It might be the suite code problem, but it's also quite possible that ScaleDB itself misbehaves, 
it needs to be investigated. 

-----------------------------

The test is still slow for me, on all machines where I tried -- different slow, but slow. 
My fastest SHOW CREATE TABLE is ~15 seconds or so. 

-----------------------------

There are things with the engine that don't seem to work properly, 
even on the surface, see for example a comment in hello_scaledb.test. 
But the test is created as an example, specifically to pass, so all problems 
are intentionally avoided.
