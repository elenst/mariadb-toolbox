Commit notification e-mail
--------------------------

To configure commit notification e-mails, do the following:

- install git;
- clone this tree;
- (optionally) copy or symlink git_template folder to some <git templates path>;
- configure git templates location globally:
  = for git versions >= 1.7.1, run 
    git config --global init.templatedir <git templates path>
  = for older git versions, set the environmemnt variable 
    GIT_TEMPLATE_DIR=<git templates path> 
    and make sure it is always set whenever you work with git;
- make sure that <git templates path>/hooks/post-commit is executable;
- (optionally) edit <git templates path>/config file:
  = check that hooks/postcommitrecipients has the desired value;
  = check that hooks/postcommitbranches has the desired value;
  = set hooks/postcommitsender to the e-mail that you want notifications 
    to be sent from;
  = configure postcommitmailer if necessary;

From now on, for all new clones of branches listed in hooks/postcommitbranches, 
commit notifications should be sent. 

If you had already cloned some trees before enabling commit notifications, 
you will need to amend those trees:

- add the hook script to the tree by either running:
  = cd <cloned folder>
    git init
  = or 
    cp <git templates path>/hooks/post-commit <cloned folder>/.git/hooks/

- copy hooks/postcommit* options from 
  <git templates path>/config to <cloned folder>/.git/config


To disable commit notification(s), set SKIP_COMMIT_EMAIL environment variable 
to a non-empty value.


Notes:

- hooks/postcommitrecipients is a *comma-separated* list of e-mails. Normally, 
  it is expected to contain the commit mailing list, but you can add some other
  address(es) or change it if you wish;
- hooks/postcommitbranches is a *space-separated* list of branches affected 
  by the post-commit hook. Asterisk wildcard is allowed. 
  Please note that these are *real* git branches, as opposed to branch nicknames. 

Examples:

Assuming you did the following
  git clone https://github.com/MariaDB/server 10.1-mdev1234
  ...
  git branch
  # * 10.1
  git commit -a

 Example 1:
  postcommitbranches = 10.0 10.1 10.2
  # The commit e-mail will be sent because the current branch is 10.1, 
  # it's on the list

  Example 2:
  postcommitbranches = 10.0-* 10.1-* 10.2-*
  # The commit e-mail won't be sent because the current branch is 10.1, 
  # it does not match the pattern 10.1-*

  Example 3:
  postcommitbranches = 10*
  # The commit e-mail will be sent
